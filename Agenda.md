# Welcome to our API Connect & LoopBack workshop!

LoopBack is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework. Building on LoopBack, IBM API Connect(APIC) is an API management solution that addresses critical aspects of the API lifecycle for both on-premises and cloud environments providing the capability to create, run, manage and secure APIs and microservices. 

Today we will give you an overview of our products(APIC and LoopBack), talk about some major concept, eg. Microservices, to help you understand the products, and also guide you to build and publish an APIC/LoopBack application, which you can play with to see how those created APIs work.
